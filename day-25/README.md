# Shader & Livecode : Beyond the math and the code

With this caldendar I hope your learned about shaders. You may have learn from scratch or sharpen some technics or even learn new things ? That's great. You might and you should continue looking around the web for more resources, experimenting on your own and you might join communities to discuss.

And one day, you might saw some events related to shaders.

For this final day of this calendar, let me present some famous shaders livecode events and why you should not be afraid participating it !

# Livecode

The livecode is a performance where you are coding live, with an audience, as if you where playing an instrument, to generate graphics or sounds.

You could think it's weird, as programming involves compilation time, and it's not straight forward to output something to be interesting for a public.

Fortunately multiple various tools has emerged to get around this limitation and theses tools make livecoding events possible.

There is as much events possible as people are creative, but I will focus on event I know better : **Shader Jam** and **Shader Showdown**.


## Shader Jam
The shader jam is like in the music world, it's a chilled moment, with some DJ or live set, where you can just code freely what you feel. There is no constraint and you can use any assets or materials you want.

It's usually a great place to start livecoding. The abscence of big constraints helps you to get familiar with this practice. You might feel overwehlmed at the begining but it's ok. The more you will practice the more you will be used to the condition and it will be less stressful.

Some shader jams are online, which are also great if you have public anxiety to start with livecoding as theses events can be done from your room.

One regular Online Shader Jam is https://www.twitch.tv/FieldFxDemo which is a weekly meeting every monday. Have a looks ! And if you feel ready, you could ask to join one of the monday jam ! Feel free to go to their discord or contact organisators to have more information on schedule.

Some demoparties also organise open Jam, last one in date was Inercia 2024, where we observed the highest number of simultanious folks livecoding !

But to be fair, onsite events are something you need to experiment once. Revision Demoparty has usually a segment during the weekend where litterally global shader jam is organised during a liveset. People around the world can join remotely, but also people onsite are joining.

But sometime, some demoparty do put the graphic coder on the scene during the shader jam, like in Sessions 2024 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfQglocVFTk .

If you participate one day to such event, here is some advise that you're free to ignore :D
* Don't stress out about the level of quality of your shader. As usually during the live set, the music evolve from chill moment to more nervious ones, it's great to have a diversity of shaders to match the current vibe. So even a simple cube spining or a circle jumping around could be the perfect match.
* Enjoy the moment. Beeing live onsite and seeing your performance on a big screen with good sound system and people dancing and cheering is really a different experience from online. Don't focus too much on your code, and take some time to breath, raise your head and witness the ambiance.

Last things, Onsite and Online are really complementary experience, especially in our time when there is streaming of event. You can't be everywhere and match everything. So don't stress about it and just enjoy your way.

## Shader Showdown
Shader showdown are another level. The main difference with the Jams is the competitive aspect.

You are participating in a match, usually between 2 or 3 people at the same time, and you are bound to a time limit, usually 25 min, to do the best visual effect. You can't have notes or copy, you can't go to internet looking for stuff, it's only you, the computer and the public.

Let's be clear, it's still just to have fun and challenge at the same time. We try to keep a good ambiance between folks. To be fair, during Revisions Shader Showdown, participants usually talks to each other and have fun before and after the showdown.
As I usualy explain to people, the goal here is not the competition as you have in esport or football for example, but more as WWE wrestler match or Theatresports . There is a sense of competition to spice it, but the performance is really a share between the participant, the dj and the public.

Shader showdown has been prominently onsite, only 2020 pandemic saw the surge of onsite showdown, but it's rarer nowdays.

Shader showdown also are seen, from people i'm talking to, as more impressive than jam which makes people more reluctant to participate.

The short play time and public is effectively something that looks challenging and stressful. But all participants have their personal approach to tackle a showdown. I'll give you my own point of view on that matter :
* I practice a lot, via jam or just solo. Not only it helps remembering functions and concepts, but also it extermly useful when you introduce a bug in your code. Because then you can calmly check what was wrong, fixed it and remember it so that if it appears live, you won't loose too much time.
* I try not to repeat too much myself into the same style or kind of production. So it forces me to looks for new things or experiment drastically different approach.
* I try to keep a balanced ratio between learning by heart things and improvisation. Which means for a 25min showdown, I usually try to find an idea before the event like a concept, or a precise scene that I could impement live within ~15min, so it leaves me ~10min to improvise.
*
If you are interested about the process, I've done a video where I redo my Revision 2024 shader and try to explain the context and how I had approach my round : https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2111592909

Again, it's personal vision and you're free to ignore or adapt to your taste :D

At the end, the real opponent is yourself, but it's good as it forces you to always seek for new ways to go through.


# The first step is always the hardest one
I hope all of this motivates you to concider going further and starting livecoding. If you are interested you can always have a look  at https://livecode.demozoo.org to see previous events and get inspried.

Happy Christmas Everyone.

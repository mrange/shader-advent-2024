# Shader Advent Calendar 2024 🎨✨

Hey there, shader enthusiasts!

Every year, I love diving into the creative energy of the [F# Advent](https://sergeytihon.com/fsadvent/). It got me thinking—why not do something just as awesome, but focused on shader art?

So, I’m proposing **Shader Advent Calendar 2024**! 🎅🎄 For each day in December, one of us will share a blog post about something cool and shader-related. It could be a technique, a concept, or even a full-on demo—whatever inspires you! And if you've got a Shadertoy/PoshBrolly link to share, even better! Each day, we’ll unveil a fresh blog post, so we’ll have something exciting to explore together leading up to Christmas.

### How to Join:

1. **Pick a shader topic**—anything goes, whether you’re a complete beginner or a shader wizard. Just make it fun and shader-related! Reach out to me on [Twitter/X @range_marten](https://x.com/range_marten) or [Mastodon @range_marten@dotnet.social](https://dotnet.social/@range_marten) to reserve your date. You don’t need to reveal your topic upfront, but feel free to tease it if you’d like.
2. **Write your post** in GitHub markdown.
3. **Submit it** either by sending it to me directly or via a pull request to the Shader Advent GitHub repo.

Let’s make this a December to remember, packed with shader magic! ✨
